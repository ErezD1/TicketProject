## 📍 Overview

Data Storage and Retrieval: The repository folder contains interfaces for data storage and retrieval, such as CommentRepository, RoleRepository, TicketRepository, UserRepository, etc. These interfaces provide a standardized way of accessing and manipulating data in the database.
Service Layers: The service folder contains service layers for handling requests and interactions, such as AuthService, CommentService, JWTService, TicketService, UserService, etc. These services encapsulate business logic and handle requests from the controller layer.
Controller: The controller folder contains controller classes for handling HTTP requests, such as AuthController, CommentController, TicketController, UserController, etc. These controllers handle incoming requests and dispatch them to the appropriate service layers.
Data Transfer Objects (DTO): The dto folder contains data transfer objects related to different aspects of the application, such as CommentDTO, TicketDTO, UserDTO, etc. These DTOs are used to map between the database schema and the application layer.
Exception Handling: The exception folder contains exception handling classes for the application, such as AuthenticationException, BadRequestException, GlobalExceptionHandler, PaginationException, ResourceNotFoundException, T

| [generate_tree.py](https://github.com/ErezD1/BackEndTicketProject/blob/master/generate_tree.py) | Start by importing the `os` module at the top of your script: `import os`.2. Use the `os.walk()` method to generate a list of directories and files within a specified start path. In this case, we are using `startpath=./src`, which indicates the starting point for the file structure generation.3. For each directory or file in the list returned by `os.walk()`, use the `os.path.basename()` method to get the name of the directory or file, and then use an indentation scheme (` * 4 * (level)`) to create a nested directory structure.4. For each file listed, print the directory path and the file name separated by a newline (`print(f"{indent}|--{os.path.basename(root)}/")`).5. Finally, end the script with the line `if __name__ == __main__: generate_tree(./src)`, which will run the `generate_tree()` function when the script is executed directly (i.e., not included as a module in another Python script).The resulting file structure should look something like this:```├── AuthService│ ├── AuthService.java│ └──...├── CommentService│ ├── CommentService.java│ └──...├──                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| [mvnw](https://github.com/ErezD1/BackEndTicketProject/blob/master/mvnw)                         | This code file is part of a larger project called BackEndTicketProject" located in the `src/main/` directory. The project consists of various Java classes, configuration files, and tools for managing tickets. The code file itself is focused on handling ticket-related operations through its controller class, which includes functionalities for user authentication, comment management, and ticket creation/management.The critical features of this code file include:1. Controller classes: The `TicketController.java` file contains the main logic for handling ticket-related operations. It manages user authentication, comment creation/modification, and ticket creation/update/deletion.2. User management: The code file includes a class called `UserControler.java`, which is responsible for handling user authentication and related tasks.3. Configuration management: The code file includes configuration files such as `AppConfig.java` and `OpenApi3Config.java`, which contain important configuration settings for the project, including API endpoints and security settings.4. Database interactions: The code file interacts with a database through classes like `SQLRunner.java`, which handle data manipulation and retrieval.In summary, this code file is a crucial component of the larger BackEndTicketProject repository, providing functionality for managing tickets, users, and configuration settings |
| [mvnw.cmd](https://github.com/ErezD1/BackEndTicketProject/blob/master/mvnw.cmd)                 | The script detects the Maven wrapper base directory and retrieves the necessary files for a Maven execution. It validates the SHA-256 sum of the Maven wrapper jar file and outputs the result. If the validate fails, it exits with an error code. Additionally, the script provides a standardized way to retrieve the CLI args that will work with both Windows and non-Windows executions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| [TicketController.java](https://github.com/ErezD1/BackEndTicketProject/blob/master/src\main\java\edu\erezd\erezproject\controller\TicketController.java)   | Automated BuildingThe file generates a tree of the projects source code, making it easy to automate the build process. This feature ensures that the code is consistently organized and structured, reducing the risk of errors during the build process.2. **Code OrganizationThe `generate_tree.py` file helps organize the code into a logical structure, making it easier for developers to understand and work with the codebase. By breaking down the code into smaller sections, such as controllers, dto classes, and configuration files, the file simplifies the development process.3. **Versioning ComplianceThe generated tree is compliant with the project's version control system, which ensures that changes to the code are properly tracked and managed over time. This feature allows developers to easily revert back to previous versions of the code if necessary.4. **Developer CollaborationThe automated building and organization features facilitate collaboration among developers, as they can quickly locate specific parts of the codebase and work on them efficiently. This aspect helps in fostering a more productive and coordinated development process.In summary, the `generate_tree.py` file serves as a critical component of the parent |

| [CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint.java](https://github.com/ErezD1/BackEndTicketProject/blob/master/src\main\java\edu\erezd\erezproject\security\CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint.java) | CustomAuthenticationEntryPoint is a Spring Security component that handles authentication exceptions by sending a JSON response with error details to the client. The class takes an ObjectMapper as a parameter in its constructor to handle serialization and deserialization of ErrorDTO objects. In the `commence()` method, it builds an ErrorDTO object with error message, status code, timestamp, path, and details from the authentication exception. Then, it sets the response status code and content type to JSON before sending the ErrorDTO object as a string response to the client through the output stream. |

| [CommentServiceImpl.java](https://github.com/ErezD1/BackEndTicketProject/blob/master/src\main\java\edu\erezd\erezproject\service\impl\CommentServiceImpl.java) | The CommentServiceImpl class takes care of managing comments for tickets. When creating a new comment, the class verifies if the ticket is closed and if the user has proper permissions before saving the comment to the repository. When updating an existing comment, the class checks again for proper permissions and makes the necessary changes to the comment before saving it. Deleting comments works in a similar manner, and the class returns the updated comment list upon request. Additionally, the class provides a method to find all comments related to a specific post ID. |
